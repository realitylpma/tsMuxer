// Optional runtime binding to libdovi, the library behind the usual Dolby Vision tooling, used to
// convert a profile 7 RPU to profile 8.1.
//
// Loaded BY NAME at run time rather than linked, for three reasons: the library is not needed for
// anything else tsMuxeR does, a prebuilt binary is published for one platform only, and its absence
// has to mean "this one feature is unavailable" rather than "tsMuxeR does not start". Nothing here
// is required to build or run tsMuxeR.
//
// Only six entry points are used, so they are declared here rather than pulling in libdovi's own
// header: that keeps a third-party header out of the tree and means no import library is needed.
// The signatures were checked against libdovi 3.4.0 by calling them.
//
// The types are opaque on purpose. DoviData is the one structure that has to be described, because
// its two fields are read directly; it is a pointer and a length and has been stable across
// releases.
